## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r image-ref-for-in-text, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Some cool caption', out.width='0.75\\linewidth', fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/AlexBowring/Covid19CCT/blob/master/docs/oxford_cases.pdf")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

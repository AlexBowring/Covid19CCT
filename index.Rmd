## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = FALSE,  warning = FALSE}
load("oxford_data.Rda")
suppressWarnings(library(dplyr))
last_point <- df %>% # last trading day
  slice(which.max(dates))
library(ggplot2, quietly=TRUE)
library(bbplot, quietly=TRUE)
ggplot(df, aes(x = dates, y = oxford_cases)) +
geom_line(colour = "#007f7f", size = 1) +
geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, colour="#333333") +
labs(x = "Date", y = "Oxfordshire Covid-19 Cases", title = "Oxfordshire Covid-19 Cases (Linear)") +
scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 days", date_labels = "%d/%m") + 
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
geom_point(data = last_point, aes(x = dates, y = oxford_cases), col = "#007f7f", shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 2, stroke = 1.7) +
geom_text(data = last_point, aes(x = dates, y = oxford_cases, label = oxford_cases), size = 6, vjust = 2.0, nudge_x = 0.5) +
bbc_style() +
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20)) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
